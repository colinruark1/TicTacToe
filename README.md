#TicTacToe
I did NOT write 'runner.py'! I supplied the file in case anyone wanted to play against my TicTacToe engine.

This was a project I tackled through Harvard University's CS50 AI course online. They supplied runner and a shell for tictactoe, and I wrote all functions within TicTacToe. Link to course: https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python The premise was to create an undefeated TicTacToe computer Engine. Now this doesn't mean the computer will win 100% of all games, but it will never lose. The computer plays tictactoe by searching millions of TicTacToe positions, and then it ultimately determines which move will create the best results.
